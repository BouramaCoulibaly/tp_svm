## This a practical work about SVM.

## SVM stands for Support Vector Machines, which is a popular supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks.

## SVM is particularly useful when the data is not linearly separable, as it can use a kernel function to transform the data into a higher-dimensional space where it becomes separable. Some common types of kernel functions used in SVM include linear, polynomial, radial basis function (RBF), and sigmoid.

## SVM has been widely used in various applications such as image classification, text classification, and bioinformatics. Its advantages include good generalization performance, ability to handle high-dimensional data, and robustness against overfitting. However, SVM can be sensitive to the choice of kernel function and parameters, and it may also suffer from slow training time on large datasets.
